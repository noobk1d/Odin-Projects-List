        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Peel your carrots and potatoes. Cube the potatoes, dice the carrots,
            and dice the onion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add cubed stew meat into a bowl and add: salt, pepper, paprika, and
            flour to the bowl. Mix thoroughly and let sit.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large pot, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the seasoned
            meat. Place the heat on high, and sear the meat on all sides. Remove
            the meat from the pot and let rest on a plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same large pot, add 2 more tablespoons of olive oil along
            with the diced onion and place on high heat. Begin to brown the
            onions. Once they reach a translucent/clear color, add the garlic
            and turn the heat to low.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the can of a dark beer, and turn the heat back up to high. Use
            the liquid to scrape the bottom of the pan to pick up any
            burnt/well-done pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the beer begins to boil, add the rest of the veggies (carrots,
            potatoes, and peas) along with the wine and tomato paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the heat to a medium to medium high, and add the stew meat. Add
            the beef broth until the ingredients are covered (you can continue
            to add more stock depending on how thick/thin you like your stew).
          </li>
          <li>Add herbs to taste.</li>
          <li>
            Let the stew simmer for 40-60 minutes or until all ingredients are
            tender.
          </li>
          <li>Serve immediately or freeze for up to a week.</li>
